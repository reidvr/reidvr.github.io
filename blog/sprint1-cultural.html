                        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
                        <p>
                            I’m usually a pretty laid back sort of guy and try not to sweat the small stuff.
                            I tend to analyse situations alot and often find myself over analysing. I enjoy a challenge
                            often jumping straight into the deep end when I see potential but occasionally overlook
                            the steps in between.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Strengths</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I’m, pretty creative and enjoy making projects look appealing
                            </li>
                            <li> I’m open-minded and flexible with a sort of live and let die attitude
                            </li>
                            <li> I dislike unresolved issues with a project and tend to poke and prod until its fixed
                            </li>
                            <li> Good sense of humour
                            </li>
                            <li> Enjoy working in a productive team environment
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Limitations</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li> I often get tunnel vision during certain activities and forget about the “bigger
                                picture”

                            </li>
                            <li> Really not a fan of public speaking

                            </li>
                            <li> My english skills are not great
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong> Which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                                intersect with learning obstacles?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I believe my problem solving skills and creativity should help out a bunch here given the
                            environment we’ll be working in. My english and public speaking issues could be an obstacle
                            but
                            will hopefully get better with practice.</p>

                                with
                                others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that
                                time,
                                how
                                effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now,
                                and
                                why.

                            In the early stages of a project during my degree, it quickly became apparent that there
                            was a
                            skill gap between the group members. Initially we didn’t address this and just did our own
                            parts of the project but when we tried to merge our work we realised that it wasn't going
                            to
                            work unless we were all on the same page. So we made sure that every team member had a
                            solid
                            understanding of what each other were doing, what tools and processes were in use and helped
                            each
                            other out if we were unsure.</p>
