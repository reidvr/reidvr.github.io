                        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
                        <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Given my past experience in IT and the workforce, I’ve come to understand 
                            the importance of good workload management especially within a team. 
                            I’ve learnt to get things done sooner rather than later and to reach out if I’ve fallen behind or get stuck. 
                            I also understand the importance of good communication to ensure that everyone is on the same page so that 
                            everything runs smoothly and deadlines are meet. I’ve seen what happens when these practices are neglected 
                            and will do my best to maintain a solid work ethic.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong></p>    

                            <p>In practice, I will first try to solve my own problems before asking the internet for help.
                             If I can’t find what i'm looking for or its taking too long, 
                             I’ll ask my peers and mentors if they can help or perhaps point me in the right direction.</p>

                             <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong></p>  

                            <p>Given my understanding of  flipped learning, I expect the facilitation team to be a guide to our learning,
                                 point us in the direction we want to go and perhaps give us a nudge if we stray too far off course.</p>

                                 <p><strong> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</strong></p>  
                            
                            <p> I don't have any block-out time in the foreseeable future.</p>
