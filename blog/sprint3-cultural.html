                        <h2>Sprint 3 Core</h2>
                        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                        <p>One's ability to be comfortable with their own emotions and empathise with others.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                        <p>IQ is more a measure of one's personal ability to perform a given skills set. EQ is a measure of how we manage
                            emotions both internally and externally.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                        <p>Because we are social creatures. Having high EQ gives us the ability communicate effectively with others and with
                            ourselves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What it was like for you to practice mindfulness?</h3>
                        <p>It's a little strange, but does kind of calm the body/mind.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?</h3>
                        <p>I've done it a couple times but didn't find it a great help.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?</h3>
                        <p>I guess it's hard to understand how it works without practicing a bunch. I've heard people rave about it, so
                            there must be something to it.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What did you notice as you were meditating?</h3>
                        <p>My breathing mostly.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How did you find the overall experience?</h3>
                        <p>Its calming in the moment.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What's your daily habit commitment?</h3>
                        <p>Meditate once a day before bed.</p>
