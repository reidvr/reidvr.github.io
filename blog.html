                    <h2>Technical blog 3</h2>
                    <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
                    <p>So a company named HTML(Happy TradesMen Limited) were tasked with building a new McDonald's restaurant.
                    They quickly set to work gathering all the building materials and before long, had erected a large structure
                    fit with a roof, walls,doorways, and window holes. They were pretty chuffed with their work but after taking
                    a step back, they realised it wasn't much to look at. Fortunately, they knew a guy named Craig Sebastian Smith(CSS)
                    who happen to be a master of aesthetics and design. In the blink of eye(A few days), he managed to turn the place
                    into yet another stunning McDonalds we all know and enjoy from time to time.</p>
                    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life,
                        for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>
                        Put simply, control flow is the order in which we perform or execute a set of tasks.
                        loops are a way of repeating tasks until a certain criteria is met. Take washing the dishes for example;
                        The normal flow of control would be to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Fill sink with hot water</li>
                            <li>Add soap</li>
                            <li>Take a dirty item</li>
                            <li>Soak in water</li>
                            <li>Scrub until clean</li>
                            <li>Leave to dry</li>
                        </ol>
 
                        Now this flow may work for most dishes but what if we had say a cast iron skillet that shouldn't be washed with soap?
                        We would have to divert the flow for this dish around step 2 and go straight to step 3 there by changing the flow depending on
                        dish type. Step 5 is also an example of looping where you repeat the task of scrubbing until the criteria of the dish being clean is
                        met. These are just a couple of examples of looping and control flow of which there could be many more in this scenario.
                        What if the water is too hot? What if a dish breaks? What if the humidity is so high our dishes aren't drying? How would these effect
                        the control flow?
 
                    <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
                        The way I see the DOM is a hierarchy of objects or nodes that provide the structure to our page. The hierarchy can often been seen
                        in the way we indent our HTML documents and is comparable to a family tree is the sense that each node can have children nodes
                        and those children can have their own nodes etc. These nodes also have their own attributes similarly to how people in your family
                        have attributes like their name, hair colour, height, etc. We can use these attribute fields to change how our nodes look and behave using CSS
                        and Javascript.
 
                    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                        Data in an <strong>array</strong> is typically accessed using an index value. The index value is the items position within the array. For example, <code>cars[0]</code>  would give you to first car in the array.
                        <br>Data in an <strong>object</strong> is typically accessed using dot(".") notation. For example, <code>car.colour</code>  would give you the colour of the car.
                    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                        Functions allow us to encapsulate a task or process so that is can be reused later on and saves us having to repeat the same code every
                        time we want preform that same task.

                        <p>A small game I made to practice JS. The ojbective is to <strong>roll</strong> the dice on your
                            turn to collect as many points as possible for that round and press <strong>hold</strong>
                            when you want to save those points. The catch is whenever you roll a <strong>1</strong>, you lose all your points
                            for that round and your turn is over. First person to <strong>100</strong> wins!
                        </p>
                        <p>Added new rule: If a <strong>6</strong> is rolled twice in a row, the player
                        loses all of their game points. =0</p>

                        <h2>Margins, Borders and Padding</h2>
                        <p>
                            These three properties seem to be used a lot in Web Development
                            and while being super useful by providing space between
                            elements, can also cause a number of unexpected issues if not
                            used in the right way as I found out the hard way. I understood
                            these properties best when viewed graphically:
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/css-box-model.png" alt="CSS-Box-Model" />
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            Together they make up what's called the "Box-Model". Each
                            element has a box around it that consists of these properties
                            and the content itself in the middle as displayed above.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Content</strong> is the actual stuff inside the element
                            like images and text.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Padding</strong> is space added between the content and
                            its border.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Border</strong> is displayed after the padding but is
                            set to 0 by default.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Margin</strong> is the space outside the border.</p>

                        <h2 class="border-break">Issues</h2>
                        <h4>Box-sizing</h4>
                        <p>
                            The biggest issue I had with this model was when it came to the
                            box dimensions itself. I would set the width of something to fit
                            neatly amongst other content only to have it bounce around the
                            page unexpectedly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a bit of investigation I found out about a property called
                            <strong>box-sizing</strong>. By default, box-sizing is set to
                            <strong>content-box</strong> and the width and height of an
                            element is calculated like this:<br />
                            <br />
                            width + padding + border = actual width of an element<br />
                            height + padding + border = actual height of an element<br />
                            <br />
                            Meaning when you set the width of an element, the element often
                            appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border
                            and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To fix this and avoid having to compute the "actual"
                            width/height of an element, we can set
                            <strong>box-sizing:border-box.</strong>
                            This allows us to include the padding and border in an element's
                            total width and height. I personally set every element to
                            border-box using the * selector for "all" so that I never have
                            to worry about this issue again.
                        </p>
